# Capstone Project - Maria Obregon Garcia
Calendar Buddy
	
## Learning Goals
- Build a full-stack app
- Firebase
- Swift/SwiftUI
- Working with different APIs

## Project Description
- People with ADHD and other types of neurodiversity often struggle with time blindness and object permanence. 
  These qualities present three main challenges: 
	- Being on time for events
	- Preparing for things that are in the future (past individual's time horizon)
	- Gauging how long task will take to complete
- This app aims to tackle the first challenge by automatically creating customizable event reminders

## MVP Featureset
- Google and Apple calendar integration
	- Events can be imported by inputing calendar's address in iCal format (Google offers secret addresses)
- Customizable reminders for tasks
	- Users create reminder preferences (preferred frequency and distribution)
- Uncluttered display of upcoming events
	- Users can easily see a focused display of their next event or the current day's events
